Do you have a Streams application that youâ€™re interested in running in the cloud?

If your application reads from the local disk or creates new files, then using one of the Object Storage services on IBM Cloud and the new toolkit could be the solution to make your files available in the cloud.

With Object Storage, your unstructured data is stored in a scalable, multi-tenant cloud environment.

You can now use the new Object Storage toolkit to access objects in Object Storage from Streams.  It provides the following features:

* Create/Delete bucket
* Put/Get object
* Delete object
* List objects

## Streaming Analytics service on IBM Cloud

This toolkit is compatible with the Streaming Analytics service on IBM Cloud.

[Introduction to the IBM Cloud Streaming Analytics service](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streaming-analytics-now-available-bluemix-2/)

### Cloud Object Storage service

* [IBM Cloud Object Storage service catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/infrastructure/object-storage-group)

## API Reference

The *com.ibm.streamsx.objectstorage* toolkit supports Object Storage services with S3 API.

* [IBM COS (S3) API](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/cloud-object-storage-infrastructure/about-api.html#about-the-cos-api)

## Cloud Object Storage Basic Terms

**Bucket**

A bucket is a logical abstraction that is used to provide a container for data. Buckets in COS are created in IBM Cloud. 
For example, you might create a bucket called `blackfriday` to be the container for all streaming data from Black Friday 
store sales and another bucket called `postxmas` for store sales on 26-Dec. You create a third bucket called `clickstream`
to contain streaming data about all online sales activity.
 
**Partition**

A partition is data that is grouped by a common attribute in the incoming schema.
Use partitions when you need to reduce the amount of data that queries must process. 
Streaming gives you access to massive amounts of data. Querying the entire data set might 
not be possible or even necessary. To improve query performance, break the data into chunks,
or partitions, and just query the chunk that you need. For example, we might want to get information 
about online shopping users who put an item into their cart. Our first partition is 
`click_event_type` so that we can query on the clickstream `add_to_cart` event. 
Next, we add the partition `customer_id` because we want to analyze each customer's online shopping behavior.
